	                        In the recent years, the outbreak of Covid-19 changes people’s life. Lots of classes move from in-person to remote. Students' learning environment and equipment for joining online school varies from person to person. The teaching mode not only changes students learning speed, but their attitudes towards school work. Thus, how do those changes affect students' digestive of course work? 
	                        In this project, we aim to identify the important features that affect the learning quality and make predictions for student's digestive based on those factors.
	                        <br> <br>
	                        The dataset we will use contains information about student's learning environment such as gender, age, device type, internet quality and so on. All of the features are categorical. Feature importance will be used to help students do self-evaluation when he/she is taking online courses.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">
                        The dataset we used is obtained from Kaggle called "students_adaptability_level_online_education" and can be found
                        here: <a class="lead" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdmahmudulhasansuzan/students-adaptability-level-in-online-education">Student Adaptability Level Data</a>.
                        The dataset contains 14 columns and 1205 instances, each corresponding
                        to a studnet. It is not surprise that all of the column variables are categorical, becasue this data is quite like a questionnaire.
                        <br> <br>
                        The dataset has one response variable, Adaptivity Level, which contains three levels: high, moderate and low. After plotting the distribution of the response varible, we find it is imbalanced. 
                        <br> <br>
                        We can plot the number of each class for our target variables to show that it is a highly imbalanced dataset:

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">
                        From the plot of adaptivity level vs. gender, we coud observe that males tend to digest new knowledge faster compared to females and the level of low adaptativity level is almost the same for both genders.
                        <br>
                        We plotted the following bar chart to show the distribution of each sex:

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">
                        Different age group tends to have various learning abilities, from the age group, we could visualize that the optimal age range of learning for students is from 11-15 and 21-25, among them, 21-15 is the range that more students reach high adaptivity level compared with other age range. 

                    </p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">
                        The reasonable class duration is also an important factor for student to digest course work efficiently. From the plot, we could see that class duration is best to be 1-3 hours for students to capture knowledges. If the class time beyond this limit, student may feel boring and hard to focus.
                    </p>

                        Also, we visualized one interesting trend of financial condition. People in middle class has the most number of adapting materials, which in turns, digesting more knowledges comparing to families with high and low financial condition.

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: left;">
                        To deal with the imbalanced dataset, we used the following two techniques: <br>
                        1. Applied <b>stratified splitting</b> when splitting the dataset into train, validation and test sets. <br>
                        2. Processed the data using <b>Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)</b>. <br>
                        To convert the categorical variables into numeric data, we apply the label encoding techniques to map the categories into 1, 0 coding(<b>LabelEncode </b>). This approach is very simple and it involves converting each value in a column to a number.

	                    Since the data is highly imbalanced, it is important to care more about the accuracy with in each class rather than the overall accuracy. Thus, we could say the random forest and the xgboost models are the optimal ones in this classification problem, given the fact that they all have 90% accurate prediction in each class.

                    <li class="lead" style="text-align: left;">We trained 4 different models to make predictions for student adaptivity level. The model selections are based on the data structures and the types of features. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="lead" style="text-align: left;">We see that Random forests and the Xgboost are the best performing model and all
                        models achieve the 80% accuracy score in classifying the target variable. Also, we could notice that finanical condition and  class duration are very importance features no matter which model we pick. It is interesting
                        to see that gender and internet type are actually not that significant in attending online education. In other words, as long as the class setting is reasonable and family supports finanical cost, everyone is expected to digest course work well.
                    </li>
                    <li class="lead" style="text-align: left;">
                    	To further imporve the project, we could modify our model to serve as a self-assessment in online learning. Asking user to input their learning background such as age, gender, class duration and internet types etc., then our system will output a general studying quality based his/her background. If we want to be more precise, we will collect more data such as colleges provided online education in geographically, the class structures, and the popularity of the teacher among students. For the model selection, we will stick on some tree-based and boosting methods, becasue they perform really well in categrical data structures.

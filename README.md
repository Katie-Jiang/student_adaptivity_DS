# Students Adaptivity Level in Online Education Analysis
*AI Camp - DS Crash Course*
### Introduction
- In this project, we applied the machine learning techinques to make classification of students' learning ability in online education. We aim to identify the important features that affect the learning quality and make predictions for student's digestive based on those factors. It helps student to do self-assessment when they decide whether to attend online courses.
- Coding Language: Python for ML/DS, Flask; Javascript/HTML/CSS for bootstrap.
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, Xgboost
- Data Set: [Student adaptivity level](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdmahmudulhasansuzan/students-adaptability-level-in-online-education)
